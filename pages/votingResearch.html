                    I got curious what research might be like, so I approached <a href="https://www.cs.angelo.edu/~rlegrand/">Dr. Rob LeGrand</a> in the ASU Computer Science department to see if there were any research topics he would like to explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. LeGrand mentioned that his <a href="https://www.cs.angelo.edu/~rlegrand/research/dissertation.pdf">dissertation</a> was on mathematically finding a optimal voting strategy for Approval-style voting systems within a voting framework thought of by <a href="https://lorrie.cranor.org/">Dr. Lorrie Cranor</a> called <a href="https://lorrie.cranor.org/dsv.html">Declared Strategy Voting</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To briefly try to describe DSV, instead of voting directly on a ballot, you instead inform a computer what your honest preferences are, as well as what kind
                    of strategy you would like it to use to maximize a particular kind of outcome. 
                </p>
                <p>Dr. LeGrand showed that in a system such as this, for a particular definition of happiness, the best strategy was a specific kind of strategy that was still 'sincere'; in other words, at no point did you choose to vote for someone you preferred less than someone you hadn't voted for.</p>
                <p>I asked if the same technique could be applied to Instant Runoff Voting (what many Americans call Ranked Choice Voting), and he said no.</p>
                <p>And then he spent the next two weeks furiously coming up with a less math-formula, more algorithmic way of achieving the same result that he achieved for Approval voting, but that could be applied to a broader range of voting systems, such as IRV/RCV, Borda, etc.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this project took place over a very short summer semester, and one in which I also had a major writing class. I didn't have as much time to work on this code as I would have preferred.</p>
                <p>However... <em>it worked!</em> The algorithmic method (once I got the code actually working) resulted in the same outcomes as what had been proven previously via mathematical formulas, and not only could be applied to RCV/IRV, Borda, and others, but started giving hints that the best strategy (for this particular definition of 'best') for an RCV/IRV voting system was an <em>insincere</em> one.</p>

                <p>Notes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>This project was more about finding a new analysis method that can be computationally applied to more voting systems, not showing one voting system was better than another.</li>
                        <li>No ideologies were studied. Voters had a randomized opinion about faceless, opinionless candidates.</li>
                        <li>We ran out of time.</li>
                        <li>My code likely has inefficiencies. I can already think of two things off the top of my head that I'd change: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Preventing the computation of debug/result output in cases where that output would never be printed</li>
                                <li>Ripping out all use of <span class="code">stringstream</span> and perhaps replacing it with overloading the <span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> operator.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
