                    I took a Technical Writing class, and needed to demonstrate that I could do Technical Writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was fairly familiar with A* Pathfinding from an Intro to Artificial Intelligence course I took, so I wrote a technical description of how basic A* Pathfinding's algoritm works to find a path between two points across an unknown landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Side note: If we interview, ask me about <em>bidirectional</em> A* Pathfinding. I actually went as far as implementing that algorithm in the Intro to AI course, and it was a blast! I just don't want to put the code up publicly online, as it would essentially be me posting the answers to assignments for that class.
