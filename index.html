Apparently I was taking more risks than his agents? I just followed the math in the textbook.)</p></div>

                    <p>My name is Joel King. I've just graduated from Angelo State University as a non-traditional student at the age of 40. I started troubleshooting computer issues when I was pulled out of my 2nd grade class (in SoÃ«gel, Germany, at an American school for military dependent children) to fix an Apple IIe that was showing nothing on the screen. (The contrast controls are hidden behind an "OpenApple+Reset" reboot key combination. They were set to zero.)</p>
                    <p>I've been fascinated with solving issues with computers and computer languages ever since. I was dabbling with QBASIC, then C++ before I hit high school. Over the course of my life I've built several PCs from parts I purchased, and dabbled in the following languages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C++ (a personal favorite)</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                        <li>Pascal</li>
